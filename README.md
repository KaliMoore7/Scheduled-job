# Scheduled-job
Hey y'all, here i have a scheduled job i created on the ServiceNow platform that runs a script at the end of the month.
P.S. I learned that SN is smart enough to know that the end of the month end differently
depending on the month so by selecting the 31st the script will run at the end of every month (February included).
